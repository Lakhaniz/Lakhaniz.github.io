        <p> <strong>Article 1:</strong> <p>This section will have two articles grouped together. The section containers are used to group ohter elements together, usually for positioning purposes so we will use them more in the later lessons. Elements may also be grouped together in a section to so that the area of th page grouped by the section be formatted wiht the same style, or background color such as this example.</p>

            <p><strong>Article 2:</strong> <p>The articles do not necessarily have to go inside the section, however if the articles are to be formatted into a single container, for example they need to be positioned or sized togehter, you can achieve this by placing both in a single section and formatting the section. The artlcles will inherit the formatting applied to the section.</p>
