        <p>Sunflowers</p>
        <br>
        
        <p>Van Gogh's paintings of Sunflowers are among his most famous. He did them in Arles, in the south of France, in 1888 and 1889. Vincent painted a total of five large canvases with sunflowers in a vase, with three shades of yello, and nothing else. In this way, he demonstrated that it was possible to create an image with numerous variations of a single color, without any loss of eloquence.</p>
